# Different Front End Frameworks
Based on Fireship's video [I built the same app 10 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuHDQhDhvPE)
## Vanilla JS
- No data binding -- which makes it very hard to read the code and refrence (eg. event listeners)
- No component based

## React
- Component based
- Data binding
- JSX -- which is a mix of real JS and HTML

## Angular
- Component based
- Data binding
- OOP
- Implaments fake HTML tags (eg. ng-if, ng-for, ng-click) and fake JS (eg. ng-model)

## Vue & Svelte
- Component based
- Data binding
- Uses a 3 part system
    - script (logic ie. JS)
    - template/main (HTML)
    - style (CSS)
- Fake HTML tags (eg. v-if, v-for, v-on) and fake JS (eg. v-model)
